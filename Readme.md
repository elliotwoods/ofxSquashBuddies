================

Squash is a library of compression algorithms with clean abstraction so that you can access a wide range of compression algorithms with a single API. This addon is an implementation of Squash (https://quixdb.github.io/squash/) for use with openFrameworks.

Go to https://quixdb.github.io/squash-benchmark/ to see which compression algorithm is best for your use case.

Squash
------
> Squash is licensed under the MIT License, which is highly permissive and allows Squash to be integrated into any application virtually without restriction. That said, please keep in mind that some plugins use libraries which are subject to more restrictive terms (such as the GNU GPL), and using Squash as an intermediary does not release you from the obligations of those licenses if you choose to actually use plugins which use those libraries. Squash includes an API for programmatically determining the license of a plugin, and it is possible to use it to avoid any GPL'd plugins even if they are installed. Each plugin's page in the C documentation lists the license of the library, or libraries, it uses.
>
> Several of the GPL libraries used by Squash plugins are also available for integration with proprietary software under commercial licenses.
